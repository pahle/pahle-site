            I was using an Intel-based ROG GL-553-VE prior to this and the
            difference is night and day. I’ve never heard the fans turn on a
            single time, even under the incredibly heavy loads I put it through
            with our various launch simulations.

            The only display on the market if you want something HiDPI and
            bigger than 27”. When you’re working at planetary scale, every pixel
            you can get counts.

          <Tool title="IBM Model M SSK Industrial Keyboard">
            They don’t make keyboards the way they used to. I buy these any time
            I see them go up for sale and keep them in storage in case I need
            parts or need to retire my main.

          <Tool title="Apple Magic Trackpad">
            Something about all the gestures makes me feel like a wizard with

            powers.

            If I’m going to slouch in the worst ergonomic position imaginable

            I don’t care if it’s missing all of the fancy IDE features everyone
            else relies on, Visual Studio Code is still the best text editor
            ever made.

            Zed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators

            I’m honestly not even sure what features I get with this that aren’t
            just part of the macOS Terminal but it’s what I use.

            I’ve been using Oh-My-Zsh for so long that I can’t even remember

            We started using Figma as just a design tool but now it’s become our
            virtual whiteboard for the entire company. Never would have expected
            the collaboration features to be the real hook.
