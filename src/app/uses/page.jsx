            I was using an Intel-based ROG GL-553-VE prior to this and the
            difference is night and day. I’ve never heard the fans turn on a
            single time, even under the incredibly heavy loads I put it through
            with our various launch simulations.

          <Tool title="Visual Studio Code">
            I don’t care if it’s missing all of the fancy IDE features everyone
            else relies on, Visual Studio Code is still the best text editor
            ever made.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Zed">
            Zed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators
            of Atom and Tree-sitter. {"It's"} also open source.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="iTerm2">
            I’m honestly not even sure what features I get with this that aren’t
            just part of the macOS Terminal but it’s what I use.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Oh-My-Zsh">
            I’ve been using Oh-My-Zsh for so long that I can’t even remember
            what the default Zsh prompt looks like.

          <Tool title="Figma">
            We started using Figma as just a design tool but now it’s become our
            virtual whiteboard for the entire company. Never would have expected
            the collaboration features to be the real hook.

          <Tool title="Notion">
            I’ve tried every note-taking app under the sun and Notion is the
            only one that’s stuck. It’s the only app I use every single day
            without fail.
